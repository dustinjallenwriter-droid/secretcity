            <h2 class="section-title">The Magic of Staying in Character</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In this multi-faceted role of Clue Staff, <em>hinting</em> belongs to the game facilitation part of the job — but we can't forget that, even when the final seconds are ticking away, <em>this is still immersive theatre</em>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Filter your hints through a narrative-based lens that furthers, rather than breaks, the game's world. By delivering hints as part of the story, players remain fully engaged in the world you and your colleagues have worked so hard to create.</p>
            <br>
            <p>These objectives will guide you:</p>
            <ul class="topic-list">
                <li>Understand how story and character shape effective hinting</li>
                <li>Practice giving hints that preserve immersion</li>
                <li>Recognize hints that enhance vs. disrupt the story</li>
                <li>Identify when stepping out of character is necessary</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why Immersion Matters</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Hints should feel like seamless moments within the story, not interruptions that remind players they're in a game.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As Clue Staff, your character is woven into the world of the game — your hints should reflect that. When you stay in character, you reinforce the narrative, making players feel like true protagonists on a quest, rather than participants being guided by an outside force.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This approach keeps the magic alive and ensures players remain emotionally invested in their journey.</p>

                        <p>Maintaining your role, voice, and demeanor ensures that every hint feels authentic to the story. Whether you're a shifty bartender or an eccentric alchemist, your character should be the lens through which all hints are delivered.</p>
                        <p>Staying in character helps players suspend disbelief and deepens their emotional connection to the experience.</p>

                        <p>Frame your hints using language and references that belong in the game's world. Instead of giving direct instructions, weave your guidance into the narrative — refer to objects, events, or lore that make sense for your character.</p>
                        <p>This keeps the illusion intact and makes hints feel like natural story beats.</p>
